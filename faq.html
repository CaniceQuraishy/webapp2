        <p> 1. How and when do I get paid for the books that sell?
            <br>
            <br>
            As an affiliate, you’ll receive payment based on the sales of your books. The payment schedule depends on the bookstore’s policies. Typically, payments are made monthly or quarterly, and you’ll receive your earnings through a preferred payment method (such as direct deposit or PayPal).
            How are the sales of my books handled as an affiliate?
            When a customer purchases a book through your affiliate link, the bookstore’s system tracks the sale. You’ll earn a commission based on the sale price. The bookstore handles order processing, shipping, and customer service related to the book sale.

            2.How do I set up an account on the bookstore website?
            <br>
            <br>
            To set up an account, visit the bookstore’s website and look for a “Sign Up” or “Create Account” link. Follow the prompts to provide your details, including your name, email address, and any other required information. Once your account is created, you can log in and access your affiliate dashboard.

            3.Do I need to disclose that I’m an affiliate on my website, newsletter, or social media posts?
            <br>
            <br>
            Yes, it’s essential to be transparent with your audience. As an affiliate, you should disclose your relationship with the bookstore whenever you promote their books. Include a clear statement such as “This post contains affiliate links,” so readers know that you may earn a commission if they make a purchase through your links.</p>
