        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am Canice Musa Quraishy, a 19-year-old student currently pursuing my undergraduate studies at Strathmore University with aspirations of becoming a DevOps Engineer. My interest in DevOps stems from its focus on software development and security, which align perfectly with my passion for technology.
        </p>

        <p>
            Although I haven't undertaken specific projects yet, I am eagerly looking forward to diving into practical experiences that will shape my journey in this field.
        </p>

        <p>
            One of my near-term goals is to excel in a Capture The Flag (CTF) competition, a challenge that I believe will enhance my skills and understanding of cybersecurity.
        </p>

        <p>
            My approach to learning and problem-solving in tech is methodical. I enjoy breaking down complex issues into manageable parts and finding systematic solutions.
